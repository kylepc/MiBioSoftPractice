Hello Michigan Software Team!

I would like every one of you to upload a text file called <yourname>.txt.

In this file I would like you to put some basic info about yourself, like:

age
year
major / minor
favorite hobby
a cool fact about you

Then, once you are done, I want you to push the file to the git repo!
We will walk you through the process, and if you have any trouble, please ask for some help!

*Make sure your file name is unique! It could cause some problems if there are repeats.
